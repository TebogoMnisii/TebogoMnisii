# 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Tebogo Mnisi  
**Data Scientist | Quantitative & Financial Analyst | Credit Risk, Actuarial & Fraud Analytics | Founder – Aureus Capital Intelligence (Demo)**

I am a data-driven analyst and quantitative developer with a strong foundation in **statistics, data science, and financial analytics**, and practical experience applying these skills to **credit risk, actuarial calculations, fraud detection, and quantitative finance problems**.

Completing Degree in **Statistics, Data Science, and Informatics** from the **University of Pretoria**, and I focus on building **analytical systems and models** that transform complex data into **actionable insights** for **risk management, pricing, lending decisions, and portfolio analysis**.

I am the founder of **Aureus Capital Intelligence (demo-stage)** — a developing analytics platform used to demonstrate applied **data science, actuarial modeling, and quantitative finance techniques**. The project is currently in **prototype/demo phase** and serves as a technical portfolio rather than a commercial product.
